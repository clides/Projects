Creating a custom deep learning model with LSTM layer from pytorch that trains from shakespeare's text.

Key takeaways from this project:
- Practical application of one-hot encoding (turning each character into an integer and storing them in a dictionary)
- General workflow for LSTM model (prepping the data, wrapper class, output of data, finetuning model, etc)
- Another practical application of using CustomDataset and DataLoader class to split data into batches
- Experimented with various combinations of loss functions and optimizers as well as finetuning hyperparameters
- First time using lr_scheduler (used StepLR this time)
- How to save and load model
- General overview of how to train a LLM
