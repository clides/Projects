Diagnosis:
Name: Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis)
Description: Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. It can be caused by bacterial or viral infections, allergies, or irritants. The most common symptoms include redness, itchiness, a gritty feeling, discharge, tearing, and sensitivity to light.

Symptoms:
Redness in one or both eyes
Itchiness in one or both eyes
A gritty feeling in one or both eyes
Discharge in one or both eyes that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning
Tearing
Sensitivity to light (photophobia)

Treatment:
Apply a compress to your eyes. To make a compress, soak a clean, lint-free cloth in water and wring it out before applying it gently to your closed eyelids. Generally, a cool water compress will feel the most soothing, but you also can use a warm compress if that feels more comfortable.
Use artificial tears or eye drops recommended by your doctor to keep the eyes moist and comfortable. Over-the-counter eye drops are typically effective for relieving symptoms of mild conjunctivitis.
For bacterial conjunctivitis, your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eyedrops or ointments. For viral conjunctivitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed, although these are generally less effective than antibiotics.
If the pink eye is caused by allergies, your doctor may recommend antihistamine eye drops or oral antihistamines to help manage symptoms.

When to see a doctor:
It is essential to consult a doctor if you suspect you have conjunctivitis, especially if symptoms are severe, do not improve within a few days, or if there is a possibility of bacterial infection. Untreated bacterial conjunctivitis may lead to more severe complications such as corneal scarring and vision loss.
