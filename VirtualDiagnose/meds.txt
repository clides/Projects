Medication Recommendation for Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis):

Medications:
1. Antibiotic Eyedrops or Ointments:
- Description: Prescribed by a doctor to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Instructions: Apply as directed by the doctor, usually several times a day for a specified duration.
- Side Effects: May vary depending on the specific medication but can include mild stinging or burning upon application.
- Precautions: Avoid touching the tip of the dropper or applicator to any surface to prevent contamination.
2. Antiviral Medications (e.g., Acyclovir, Famciclovir):
- Description: Prescribed by a doctor for treating viral conjunctivitis, often in more severe cases.
- Instructions: Take orally as directed by the doctor, usually several times a day for a specified duration.
- Side Effects: May include nausea, vomiting, headache, or diarrhea. Consult your doctor if side effects persist.
- Precautions: Antiviral medications are not always effective against viral conjunctivitis and may have more severe side effects compared to antibiotic treatments.
3. Artificial Tears or Eye Drops (e.g., Systane, Refresh):
- Description: Over-the-counter eye drops that can provide relief for dryness, redness, and irritation caused by conjunctivitis.
- Instructions: Apply as needed, usually 1-2 drops in each affected eye.
- Side Effects: Mild stinging or burning upon application, which should subside quickly.
- Precautions: Avoid using artificial tears if you have an allergy to any of the ingredients listed on the product label.
4. Antihistamine Eye Drops (e.g., Patanol, Alaway):
- Description: Prescribed by a doctor for treating allergic conjunctivitis.
- Instructions: Apply as directed by the doctor, usually several times a day for a specified duration.
- Side Effects: Mild stinging or burning upon application, which should subside quickly. Other side effects may include dry mouth or drowsiness.
- Precautions: Avoid using antihistamine eye drops if you have an allergy to any of the ingredients listed on the product label.

Expected Recovery Time:
The recovery time depends on the cause and severity of the conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis can improve within 3-5 days after starting antibiotics, while viral conjunctivitis typically resolves on its own within 7-14 days. If symptoms do not improve or worsen after 2-3 days of treatment, consult your doctor.

When to see a doctor:
Consult your doctor if you experience severe symptoms, such as intense pain, extreme sensitivity to light, or if the infection does not improve within a few days. Untreated bacterial conjunctivitis may lead to more severe complications such as corneal scarring and vision loss.
