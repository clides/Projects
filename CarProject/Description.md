Using OpenCV to detect bounding boxes of current car as well as other objects the camera captures, it then checks whether the other objects are too close to the car, if so, it gives a warning that you cannot turn right now otherwise you will collide

Key takeaways:
- Working with CV2 and bounding boxes
- Drawing/displaying various info on screen with cv2
- Calculating fps with time
