Creates a simple linear regression model that takes in 3 features (Year, Present Price, KMs Driven) and outputs a selling price

 Key takeaways:
 - Experience with creating a deep learning linear regression model from scratch
 - Experience with machine learning/deep learning workflow: reading/preprocessing the data -> creating custom dataset -> creating the model -> creating training and testing loop for model -> evaluating the model
 - First time trying out customdatasets with DataLoader, TensorDataset, Dataset libraries as well as splitting data into batches for more optimal training
