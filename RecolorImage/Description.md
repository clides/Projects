**Key Takeaways:**
- Load pretrained model with opencv
    - prototext file: defines architecture of the neural network
    - caffemodel file: contains pretrained weights of the neural network
    - npy file: contains necessary points for colorization
- Working with LAB color scheme (lightness, color values)
- Data preprocessing to make it work with the model
